# 📘 C++ Algorithm Error Log 🐾

## 🚀 Introduction
Welcome to my **C++ Algorithm Error Log**! 🎉 This repository is dedicated to documenting the algorithmic challenges I've encountered during my coding journey, particularly those that I've solved incorrectly. It serves as a personal error log, helping me to learn from my mistakes and improve my problem-solving skills in C++.

## 📚 Purpose
- To record and analyze the solutions to algorithmic problems that I've initially solved incorrectly.
- To provide detailed explanations and correct solutions for future reference.
- To serve as a learning resource for anyone interested in mastering C++ and algorithms.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C++**: The primary programming language used for implementing solutions.
- **Codeforces**, and other competitive programming platforms for problem sourcing.

## 💻 Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find a mistake in any of the solutions or have an alternative approach, please submit a pull request or create an issue.
